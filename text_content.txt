Introduction of Python and JavaScript
Last edit: April 17, 2023 By Bolin LIU
In the field of computer science, Python and Javascript are two very well-liked languages. In this section, we would like to Introduce Python and JavaScript. 
This is demonstrated below: 
________________________________________
Python
Python is a popular high-level programming language used for a variety of applications ranging from web development to scientific computing. Guido van Rossum invented it in the late 1980s, and it has since become one of the world's most popular programming languages.
Python's success stems from its simplicity and ease of usage. Python has a simple syntax that is easy to understand and write, making it an excellent language for novices. It also has a huge and active developer community, so there are lots of tools to assist you learn and debug any difficulties you may have.
Python is an interpreted language, which means it is run line by line rather than being pre-compiled. As a result, it's an excellent solution for quickly developing and testing code. Python also provides support for the object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming paradigms.
Python's vast standard library, which contains modules for everything from regular expressions to web development, is one of its defining qualities. Python also has a thriving ecosystem of third-party packages, which can be readily installed via the pip package manager.
Overall, Python is a robust and adaptable programming language that is suitable for both novice and expert developers. Python is a language that you should consider studying whether you are new to programming or seeking to construct complicated applications.
________________________________________
Javascript
JavaScript is a popular computer language used to generate interactive and dynamic web sites. Brendan Eich designed it in the mid-1990s, and it has since become one of the world's most popular programming languages.
One of JavaScript's primary advantages is its ability to alter web page information in real-time, which makes it an excellent language for developing dynamic and interactive user experiences. JavaScript is also used to create apps that run on both the client-side (in the browser) and the server-side (on the web server). JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means it is performed line by line rather than being pre-compiled. This makes it an excellent choice for web development since changes can be made and tested rapidly without recompiling the entire application. Because JavaScript has a big and active developer community, there are several resources accessible to assist you learn and debug any difficulties you may experience. It also includes a thriving ecosystem of tools and frameworks, including as React, Angular, and Vue, that may be utilized to make complicated online applications easier to design.
Overall, JavaScript is a versatile and strong programming language that is required for web development. JavaScript is a language that you should consider learning if you are constructing a basic website or a complex online application.

JavaScript and Python are both top 10 popular programing languages in the world and are used for a wide range of applications. Because of their strengths and weakness, they are used for different purposes. 
________________________________________
JavaScript
JavaScript is well-known as a front-end programing language, meaning it is used for develop an application for the interaction with users, but not the data, like a reaction of a button or a text box. Also, it means that JavaScript is commonly not used for back-end development, the control on the server or database. 
Web Development
JavaScript is mainly used for website development to control the behaviors of the website. It makes the website more flexible and interesting. For example, the website will pop up different content by clicking different buttons. In a website, JavaScript provides and create the interactions, like mouseover action and animations, and make it more user-friendly, like a game and go-top button. 
Enter your guess between 1 and 100:
Node.js
Node.js is a operation environment, introducing in 2009, that allow developers to run JavaScript on server side. It makes developers possible to create a wide range of applications with JavaScript, such as command-line tool, and desktop applications. One of the advantages of Node.js is using JavaScript as a back-end programming language, meaning that it is not require to use 2 languages for front-end and back-end to reduce the cost of development. Also, it makes the programs faster and more efficient. 
Here is a Youtube video talking about what Node.js can do:

Python
Python is one of the most popular programing languages because of easy to read. Nowadays, Python is used in different ways, like artificial intelligence (AI), file management, and web crawling. Compare with JavaScript, Python is better for handling data. So, Python is commonly used for back-end development.
Data Science
Python is a well-known language for data science, as a lot of powerful open-source libraries like Pandas can be imported easily to manage the data. Because of the libraries used for web crawling, like BeautifulSoup, Python can not only used for data analysis, but also used for collecting data. 
This is an example how to build a scatter plot by Python. From www.kaggle.com/code/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python
Personal Desktop Applications
Python is one of the most beginner-friendly programing languages and it allows beginners to spend a short time to learn how to develop a program for personal-use, like file management. For example, using the library ‚Äúos‚Äù, the program can get all file name in giving folder path and change the file location by change the file name (file path). Besides, since there are a lot of open-source libraries and great community, more and more things beginners can do, like creating a bag of picture or gif, and writing word documents with pattern or repeating context. 
Here is a 19 lines Python program to move all files to a single root folder.
Machine Learning
Python is also known as a machine learning language. Recently, AI drawing and AI chatting is very popular. In personal computer, Python can train a personal model to generate picture or chat by using libraries, like PyTorch. 
Stable Diffusion webUI is the most famous AI drawing program which is using Python to build, source: github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui 
Syntax Differences between Python and JavaScript
Last edit: April 6, 2023 By Charlie Lau
In the field of computer science, Python and Javascript are two very well-liked languages. In this section, we would like to investigate the syntactic differences between Python and JavaScript. 
This is demonstrated below: 
________________________________________
Code block
Python
The amount of whitespace in Python indicates to the computer what is and is not a component of a function. Users may use space or tab to perform the indentation. Without proper indentation, the program will probably result with an error. 
JavaScript
The amount of whitespace in Javascript has no meaning. A Javascript code block can be defined with curly brackets ("{}") for grouping statements to be executed together. To make it easier to comprehend, indentation will also being used. 
________________________________________
How to define Variable?
Python
The equal sign ("=") is put after the variable name when creating variables in Python. 
JavaScript
Users can define variables in JavaScript by using the terms var, let, and const. 
________________________________________
Commenting
Code comprehension is aided by comments. For future use, one might remark on a paragraph, for example.
Python
1.	Single-line comments
Python will treat anything that comes after the hashtag ("#") as a comment.
2.	Mulit-line comments
For each line of a multi-line comment, Python will begin with a hashtag ("#"), as shown below:
JavaScript
1.	Single-line comments
JavaScript will treat anything that comes after the double slashes ("//") as a comment.
2.	Mulit-line comments
Unlike Python, JavaScript can use the symbols ("/*") and ("*/") to wrap up a multi-line comment. 
________________________________________
Logical operators
Python
‚Ä¢	and is the AND operator
‚Ä¢	or is the OR operator
‚Ä¢	not is the NOT operator
JavaScript
‚Ä¢	&& is the AND operator
‚Ä¢	|| is the OR operator
‚Ä¢	! is the NOT operator
________________________________________
Inputs & Outputs
Python
1.	Inputs
In Python, the function input() can be used for asking input. Variables would be assigned to store the input data.
2.	Outputs
In Python, the function print() can be used to show the results.
Result of the print() function:
JavaScript
1.	Inputs
In JavaScript, the function prompt() can be used for asking input.
2.	Outputs
By using the console.log() function in JavaScript, users can send the values inside the bracket to the terminal and display them.
üëáTo try the coding mentioned above, click the button below. 
(Apart from using the console.log() function, we will use another function document.getElementById().value to show the outcome in the textbox) 
________________________________________
If-Conditional
The main Syntax difference between the two languages' if-condition expressions is that Python uses "elif" rather than "else if".
Python
In Python, the users have to put the colon (":") after the condition.
JavaScript
In JavaScript, the users have to put the condition inside the brackets ("()")
üëáAgain, do not hesitate to test the script above!üòú
________________________________________
Loops
The concept called "loop" is available in almost all computer languages, and it allows for the repeated execution of one or more statements.
In this section, we will introduce two type of loops, which are For-Loop and While-Loop. 
The For-Loop is often used to carry out a task a finite number of times. 
The While-Loop is used to carry out a task repeatedly as long as a continuation condition is true. 
Python
1.	For-Loop
In Python, users may use the keyword in and the function range() to perform the iteration.
2.	While-Loop
In Python, the users have to put the colon (":") after the condition. The loop would end once the condition become false
JavaScript
1.	For-Loop
In JavaScript, users have to define several values within the brackets. In the brackets, users must specify the loop variable with its starting value (e.g., var i = 0), the condition that must be true to keep the loop running (e.g., i <= 99), and how each loop will change the loop variable (e.g., i++). Moreover, each expression need to be separated by a semicolon (";"). 
2.	While-Loop
In JavaScript, the syntax is acutally similar to Python, except that users have to put the condition inside the brackets.

Python vs JavaScript: Library Usage
Last edit: April 17, 2023 By Sannie Cheung
JavaScript and Python support the library function, which is the pre-written Python/ JavaScript code collection. Python libraries are used to perform specific tasks or solve specific problems. Conversely, JavaScript libraries add functionality or effects to a web page. In this section, we would like to introduce the libraries in Python and JavaScript. 
________________________________________
JavaScript Libraries
JavaScript has a vast collection of libraries for client-side scripting and server-side development. These libraries can be readily installed and imported using package managers like npm. Utilizing the Javascript library function would help you implement standard functionality you're your web instantly. Here are some popular JavaScript libraries you may hear of: 
1.	React
React is a popular front-end JavaScript framework that automatically updates the DOM whenever your data changes. The key to React's power is composable components. You build encapsulated components once and reuse them throughout your application. For example, you might create an EmojiSearch component for search functionality, a Comment component for comments, and Auth component for authentication. Then compose them together to build the page you want. 
Emoji Search
As shown in the emoji search demo, you can create reusable components for search, comments, filters, etc. Then compose them together in different ways to generate multiple pages from a single set of components. Whenever the underlying data updates, React efficiently re-renders only the changed components. 
In summary, React revolutionized front-end development by handling updates, facilitating composable components, and enabling adaptable user experiences. You get to focus on designing interfaces instead of manually updating the DOM. 
2.	jQuery
For adding some interactivity to your pages, jQuery is fun. It has shortcuts for animations, getting external data, event responses, and updating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements - all in simple lines of code. Try this: 
Click Me!
3.	Moment.js
Dates are tricky, so Moment.js was a lifesaver. It helps format dates in any locale, handle timezones and daylight savings, give relative dates like "tomorrow", and convert between calendars. Extra plugins provide internationalization, time differences, duration, and holiday functionality. Finally, a dating tool that works! No more searching documentation to figure out which method does what. Moment hides date complexity so you can focus on building impressive web apps.

Python Libraries
Pythonprovides many libraries for scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and web development. Unlike JavaScript, these libraries are required to download through Python's package manager, pip. After that, they can be easily used in your code by import the library. Here are some popular libraries you hear of:
1.	NumPy
NumPy is great for working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It is essential for engineering and science domains. Fast array operations and integration of C/C++ or Fortran code are performed efficiently. 
2.	Pandas
Pandas simplified working with tabular data. It is perfect for analyzing and manipulating data tables. CSV files could be loaded into data frames. Selected columns, stats computed row-wise or column-wise, grouping data, pivoted and merged datasets effortlessly by using Pandas. Example: 
Result:
Random
The random library is great for generating random numbers and shuffling sequences. You can use random.randint() to get a random integer in a specified range, random.random() to get a float between 0 and 1, and random.shuffle() to randomly shuffle the elements of a list.
