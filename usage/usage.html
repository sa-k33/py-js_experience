				<p style="font-size: larger;">
					<span class="keyword">JavaScript</span> and <span class="keyword">Python</span>
					are both top 10 popular programing languages in the world and are used for a wide range of
					applications.
					Due to their strengths and weakness, they are often used for different purposes.
				</p>
			</section>
			<hr />
			<section id="JavaScript">

				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<p>
					<span class="keyword">JavaScript</span> is primarily used for front-end development,
					meaning it controls the behavior of the program-user, like a reaction of a button or a text box.
					Also, it means that JavaScript is commonly not used for back-end development,
					the control on the server or database. </br>
				</p>
				<h3>Web Development</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="keyword">JavaScript</span> is mainly used for controlling the behaviors of the website.
					It allows the website to be more flexible and interesting.
					For example, the website will pop up different pictures by clicking different buttons.
					In a website, <span class="keyword">JavaScript</span> ensures the interactive of it,
					like mouseover action and animations, and make it more user-friendly, like a game and go-top
					button.</br>
					Here is a example of small game built by <span class="keyword">JavaScript</span>
				</p>
				<p>Enter your guess between 1 and 100:</p>
				<input type="text" id="guessInput">
				<button onclick="guessnumber()">Guess</button>
				<p id="a"></p>

			<hr />
			<section id="Python">
				<h2>Python</h2>
				<p>
					<span class="keyword">Python</span> is one of the most popular programing languages because of easy
					to read.
					Nowadays, Python is used in different ways, like artificial intelligence (AI), file management, and
					web crawling.
					Compare with JavaScript, <span class="keyword">Python</span> is better for handling data.
					So, Python is commonly used for back-end development.</br>
				</p>
				<h3>Data Science</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="keyword">Python</span> is a well-known language for data science, as a lot of powerful
					open-source libraries like Pandas can be imported easily to manage the data.
					Because of the libraries used for web crawling, like BeautifulSoup, <span
						class="keyword">Python</span> can not only used for data analysis, but also used for collecting
					data.
				</p>

					This is an example how to build a scatter plot by Python. From

				</P>

				<h3>Personal Desktop Applications</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="keyword">Python</span> is one of the most beginner-friendly programing languages and it
					allows beginners to spend a short time to learn how to develop a program for personal-use, like file
					management.
					For example, using the library “os”, the program can get all file name in giving folder path and
					change the file location by change the file name (file path).
					Besides, since there are a lot of open-source libraries and great community, more and more things
					beginners can do,
					like creating a bag of picture or gif, and writing word documents with pattern or repeating context.

					Here is a 19 lines Python program to move all files to a single root folder.</br></br>
				</p>


				<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="keyword">Python</span> is also known as a machine learning language. Recently, AI
					drawing and AI chatting is very popular.
					In personal computer, Python can train a personal model to generate picture or chat by using
					libraries, like PyTorch.
				</p>

					Stable Diffusion webUI is the most famous AI drawing program which is using Python to build, source:
