                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p><span class="keyword">Python</span> is a popular <span class="keyword">high-level programming
                        language</span> that is used for a wide range of applications, from web development to
                    scientific
                    computing. It was created in the late 1980s by <span class="keyword">Guido van Rossum</span> and has
                    since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons for Python's popularity is its simplicity and ease of use. Python has a <span
                        class="keyword">clean syntax</span> that is easy to read and write, making it a great language
                    for
                    beginners to learn. It also has a large and active community of developers, which means there are
                    plenty
                    of resources available to help you learn and troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.</p>
                <p>Python is an <span class="keyword">interpreted language</span>, which means that it is executed
                    line-by-line rather than compiled beforehand. This makes it a great choice for prototyping and
                    testing
                    code quickly. Python also supports <span class="keyword">object-oriented programming, functional
                        programming, and procedural programming paradigms</span>, making it a versatile language that
                    can be
                    used in a variety of contexts.</p>
                <p>One of the key features of Python is its extensive standard library, which includes modules for
                    everything from regular expressions to web development. Python also has a large <span
                        class="keyword">ecosystem of third-party packages</span> that can be easily installed using the
                    pip
                    package manager.</p>
                <p>Overall, Python is a powerful and flexible language that is great for beginners and experienced
                    developers alike. Whether you are just starting out with programming or looking to build complex
                    applications, Python is a language that you should consider learning.</p>

                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p><span class="keyword">JavaScript</span> is a popular programming language that is used to create
                    interactive and dynamic web pages. It was created in the mid-1990s by <span class="keyword">Brendan
                        Eich</span> and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
                </p>
                <p>One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate web page content in real-time,
                    which
                    makes it a great language for creating dynamic and interactive user experiences. JavaScript is also
                    used
                    to build applications that run on both the <span class="keyword">client-side</span> (in the browser)
                    and
                    the <span class="keyword">server-side</span> (on the web server).</p>
                <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line-by-line rather than
                    compiled
                    beforehand. This makes it a great choice for web development, as changes can be made and tested
                    quickly
                    without the need to recompile the entire program.</p>
                <p>JavaScript has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources
                    available to help you learn and troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. It also has a rich
                    ecosystem
                    of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue, which can be used to simplify the
                    development of complex web applications.</p>
                <p>Overall, JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language that is essential for web development.
                    Whether
                    you are creating a simple website or a complex web application, JavaScript is a language that you
                    should
                    consider learning.</p>

                        formatted
                        string literals, asynchronous generators and comprehensions, and a new secrets module for
                        generating
                        cryptographically secure random numbers.</p>
                    <li>2018</li>
                    <p>Python 3.7 is released. This version includes many new features and improvements, such as data

                    <li>1995</li>
                    <p>Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape, creates a new scripting language called Mocha, which is
                        later
                        renamed to LiveScript, and eventually to JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>The first version of JavaScript is released in Netscape Navigator 2.0. This version includes
                        support
                        for basic scripting, such as form validation and mouse rollovers.</p>
                    <li>1997</li>
                    <p>ECMAScript is created as a standard for JavaScript. This version includes many new features, such

                    <p> The browser wars between Netscape and Microsoft result in the introduction of many new
                        JavaScript
                        features, such as XMLHttpRequest, which enables the creation of dynamic web applications.</p>
                    <li>2002-2005</li>
                    <p>The rise of Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) leads to increased use of JavaScript for
                        creating
                        responsive and interactive web applications.</p>
                    <li>2005</li>
                    <p>esse James Garrett coins the term "Ajax" in an article on his website.</p>

                        rest
                        and spread operators, and Object.values/Object.entries.</p>
